  ## Description
  MVP for Tech blog using Sequelize, MySQL, Node

This was one I was very excited to work on because it was a full stack project with no starter code. I plan on coming back to this and making it fully functional with categories, tags, user permissions, etc. and incorporating it into my actual portfolio page, not just as a project OF my portfolio.

  ## Questions
  If you have any questions, please contact me at jeff.zenko@gmail.com. You can also find me on GitHub at [codemodeactivate](https://github.com/codemodeactivate).
  ## Future Development

Some of the functionality is built in which is where there are a lot of empty files or things that may not make sense. At some point, about halfway through the project, I switched gears and focused on just the MVP for acceptance criteria to get this 'DONE' so that I would work on Project 2 with the group.
